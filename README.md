# No-SQL
Module 12

**File Location **
All files for the assignment can be found in the main folder of this repository.

For the first two parts of the assignment, the syntax is saved in the file "NoSQL-setup.starter.ipynb." The analyses are self-contained in that jupyter file.

The other file of note is the "NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb file, which contains all of the syntax for part 3. 

**Syntax Sources **
I did recieve some assistance from teaching assistants on a few parts of the assignment. Unfortunately, I am working through this class on a government laptop, and I ran into bureaucratic slowdowns on installation, and did not get access to needed programs until the last day of the No SQL unit.
As such, I ended up getting some syntax from learning assistants for the first data type change in part 2. I also ran into a small mistake (that took place in part 2) that affected my output in part 3. While trying to troubleshoot the issue, I was given some code for question 3 of the final part of this assignment. The code I had in place initially would have likely still worked, but I ended up replacing it with copied code from the learning assistant to try to locate the source of the issue. 

I did also look at a few websites to figure out how to update some of the restaurant info. The website I used syntax from was: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mongodb_update.asp#:~:text=You%20can%20update%20a%20record,the%20first%20occurrence%20is%20updated

All of the remaining code was self-generated or was copied and altered from class material.
